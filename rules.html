When this rule is broken involving things like sexual orientation, you will most likely get banned. I accept people for who they are, I do not tolerate people making fun of someone's sexual orientation or hobbies. This rule is formed this way to let you know I accept people that are part of the LGBTQ community, people that are furries, therians, etc.</li>
